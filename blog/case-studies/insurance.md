# Case Study: Social Media Management meets Gumnut

A major insurance firm needed a better way for support teams to collaborate with customers on complex forms. These forms are critical to the business, being used for everything from claims to policy updates, but were traditionally filled out in isolation by support staff or clients. This often led to missing context, back-and-forth follow-ups, and delays in processing. They wanted a solution that would let support teams and clients work together in real time, inside the form itself.

Gumnut enabled real-time collaboration across these high-value forms, allowing support agents and clients to co-author submissions live. This reduced the need for back-and-forth emails, improved accuracy, and gave teams full visibility into what was being written and when. Integrated AI agents also helped validate form inputs and suggest missing information, reducing intervention time and streamlining processing.

Great service happens when support teams and customers can work together. By enabling real-time collaboration across a suite of insurance forms, Gumnut helped transform the firm’s workflows from sequential to shared. The result is faster service, fewer delays, and a clearer sense of shared ownership—making the process feel more human, more transparent, and more aligned.

# Case Study: Social Media Management meets Gumnut

A major social media management platform was looking to transform how teams collaborated on creating and publishing social content. There was no clear process for managing and reviewing posts, version histories were unclear, and there was no audit trail present on who authored what. They needed a solution that enabled teams to collaborate in real time, clearly track authorship, and easily compare minor wording changes of different versions.

Gumnut integrated real-time collaboration directly into the social media management workflow. Teams can co-create posts live, seeing instant edits, feedback and suggestions. Gumnutâ€™s built-in audit trails provided clarity by tracking exactly who authored each post, down to the character, and facilitated version control enables easy reverts to a previous version.

The real magic of this partnership was in bringing transparency and clarity into the creative process. Instead of guessing who made what changes or struggling to revert errors, teams could focus purely on creativity, knowing exactly how and why content evolved. Collaboration became seamless, auditing effortless, and the end result: social content that felt authentic, aligned, and confidently team-owned.

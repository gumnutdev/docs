# Case Study: Gumnut meets Grant application software

A large grant application SaaS platform in Australia and New Zealand wanted to enable multiple users to apply for grants simultaneously in real-time. Grants applications can be long, complicated and require expert knowledge from many stakeholders. Previously this was solved by answering the questions in google docs and copying the questions and answers into the platform, which was a frustrating experience for all. Gumnut enabled all of their application fields, including dropdown, sliders and text inputs to have real-time collaboration for their grant applications. This increased the average session duration by over 35% as users could use the platform seamlessly to complete applications.

Gumnut hosts its own real-time collaboration infrastructure which could be embedded into the grant form builder in hours for testing, and was deployed to production in a matter of days. The ability to seamlessly switch between versions of the applications is a feature often used by users and ensures no data is ever lost.

The beauty of this partnership was the speed of execution and the immediate benefits to users. Gumnut slotted in and upgraded their platform seamlessly, showed what is possible by making grants a collaborative workspace.

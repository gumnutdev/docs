# Beyond the helpdesk - AI human collaboration frontiers

I recently read [this article in Enterprise Times](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2025/06/12/human-workers-and-ai-agents-collaboration-the-key-says-zahra-bahrololoumi-at-salesforce-world-tour-in-london/) about how human/ai collaboration is key. I've been thinking about this topic for a while, and it's really cool to see how enterprises are actively working on this, to make the user experience and productivity amazing, and AI can do a lot to improve that.

## ðŸŽ¤ World tour ðŸ’ƒ

The article does focus on the [Salesforce World Tour](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/events/london/) which was recently in London, and I didn't know that it was a rock-concert-like _actual_ world tour. But it definitely is, they're even coming to Australia in a [couple of weeks](https://www.salesforce.com/au/events/) ðŸ¤˜

Salesforce's impressive statistic is Agentforce-resolving 84% of customer support queries with minimal human intervention-is a testament to the strides made in AI-driven automation. Only 2% required human intervention. Honestly these numbners are really impressive. But it represents just the initial phase of AI's potential in the enterprise.

The transition to AI-first operations is not just a trend (lol, genius). According to the [Digital Enterprise 2025](https://community.nasscom.in/communities/digital-transformation/digital-enterprise-2025-advancing-ai-first-enterprise) report by Nasscom and Avasant, 27% of companies have AI in production or at scale, with another 31% at the proof-of-concept stage. Furthermore, 74% of enterprises expect AI spending to increase in 2025, underscoring the growing emphasis on AI integration in enterprises.

The thing that I think is missing from these kinds of presentations/reports (sorry enterprise, I promise I don't hate you), is _what does that actually look like tomorrow?_

Is it really just answering emails and customer support requests? I don't think anyone thinks that, but what does the future of human and AI collaboration look and feel like moving forward?

This is where the startup space can provide a bit of a window into that future.

## ðŸš€ The future

I think a good company to look at is [Relevance AI](https://relevanceai.com/) in this space.

Relevance lets companies create a whole "AI workforce" (literally), each agent can spawn a series of sub-agents (in their new product Workforce). You can construct a whole network of agents to perform a tasks.

The reason you do this, is, just like humans, agents are much more effective when you can absract larger tasks into smaller, manageble pieces, and have a dedicated agent to just do that thing.

Most of the applications I've seen so far are in sales research, answering emails/queries. But it's actually configurable to the extent that you can imaging _any_ application involving AI to be done autonomously. Including any external tools callable via MCP, by agents inside Relevance.

## ðŸ¤¸ The human part

But there thing that's missing in that, is _where is the human interaction?_ What does Human/AI interaction look like?

Right now, it's in interfaces like _Cursor_ - you have a chat window, you type and it does stuff.

![Cursor interface (I did write this article in Cursor)](/public/images/cursor-interface.png)

Companies like [Gumnut](https://gumnut.dev) (disclosure: my company, but you are on my blog...) are interesting in that - we have a real-time collaboration platforms where AI can type alongside you as a co-pilot. Think Google Docs, but the colleagues you're typing with are AI agents typing alongside you.

We'll see what [Liveblocks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/steven-fabre-5510bb38_nothing-meaningful-is-built-alone-that-activity-7338946791880511490-FYQL)) is cooking in this space too in the coming weeks.

There are lots of _interface_ questions as to the best way to interact with AI agents as you type alongside them. Is it just another Cursor-like chatbot like [TipTap](http://tiptap.dev/product/ai-agent) have? Or something else?

We'll have a lot more to say on this soon ðŸ‘€, but if you want to try it yourself (and you're in Sydney), come to our [hackathon](https://gumnut.dev/hack) on July 2nd and see what you can come up with!

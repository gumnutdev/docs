# AI agent adoption in enterprise

I read an interesting article on the adoption of AI agents in the [New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/xplore/2025/May/31/from-experimentation-to-deployment-it-firms-now-focus-on-ai-agents-2), and how they are being adopted in enterprise.

::: info QUOTE
Currently, 27% of enterprises report having AI agents in production or at scale, while 31% are at the proof-of-concept (PoC) stage, and another 30% plan to initiate PoCs or scale deployments in CY2025. Enterprises are expected to spend 3-4X more on AI agents in CY2025 as a result of synchronous AI systems

The figures come from [this report](https://community.nasscom.in/communities/digital-transformation/digital-enterprise-2025-advancing-ai-first-enterprise) from Nasscom. The report is quite interesting in that it covers _what is being spent_ on AI by enterprises.

Here is the graph that illustrates these figures:

## What it covers

The article and report certainly highlights the adoption of AI agents increasing across enterprises in 2025. I don't think that comes as a shock to... anyone. It does give an interesting sector breakdown:

I'm surprised regualted industries like banking and healthcare feature so highly, honestly. Maybe manufacturing is already so heavily automated that AI doesn't really make that much of a difference to automation processes?

## What it misses

What I'd really love to see is _how_ AI agents are being deployed/utilised across sectors. Are enterprises building them in-house? Are they migrating to AI workforces like [Relevance AI](https://relevance.ai/) to automate tasks? Or just using something like [Lyzr](http://lyzr.ai/) to deploy multi-agents systems?

Or are they just automating processes by using ChatGPT/Gemini/_insert provider here_ to automate writing emails like everyone else?

Maybe that's a little facetious, the [New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/xplore/2025/May/31/from-experimentation-to-deployment-it-firms-now-focus-on-ai-agents-2) does say:

Leveraging advanced machine learning and cognitive architecture, the agents are equipped with powerful capabilities such as data extraction to transform raw inputs into actionable insights and multimodal functionality to handle diverse data types effectively

Although helping deal with messy data doesn't sound to me like they're mass replacing data scientists with AI, more like the processes are more streamlined. Though aren't we all doing that?

I really think that the enterprises to _really_ jump on embedded AI into their systems processes will be able to move fast. The thing is though, is that startups move faster, so I think we're living in a very interesting time.

A major tech company was exploring ways to improve how internal teams collaborate on drafting and reviewing emails. Their internal email tool was used across departments for everything from project updates to leadership comms. But the process often felt disjointed—content lived in separate docs, feedback was scattered, and aligning on tone or structure was time-consuming. They wanted a more fluid, collaborative way to write together inside their existing workflow.

Gumnut was integrated directly into their internal email drafting tool, enabling real-time co-authoring by multiple contributors. Teams could brainstorm, write, and refine emails live—seeing each other’s changes as they happened. Gumnut’s AI agents provided inline support to help apply the company’s internal style guide automatically, suggesting adjustments to tone, structure, and clarity as the team worked. The result was faster collaboration, more consistent communication, and less time lost in formatting and back-and-forth.

What made this partnership stand out was the shift from isolated editing to shared creation. By enabling real-time collaboration within their internal tools, Gumnut helped transform writing from a fragmented process into a seamless team effort. It created space for creativity, alignment, and shared ownership—making internal communication more effective, more consistent, and more collaborative.

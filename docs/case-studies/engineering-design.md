# Case Study: Gumnut adding versioning and history to engineering design

A leading engineering design platform wanted to launch a new teams offering for their users. The goal was to make collaboration seamless — adding a review process, leave comments, track history, and undo mistakes within the same workspace. Previously, engineers shared designs manually through exports and screenshots, then reviewed changes offline or in long comment threads. This process was slow, error-prone, and made it hard to understand how projects evolved over time.

By integrating Gumnut, the platform added real-time version control to every project. Engineers can now undo edits instantly, replay design progress step by step, and capture snapshots at key stages. The integrated history view shows exactly who changed what and when, and rollbacks restore earlier states instantly without affecting ongoing work.

The Gumnut integration was completed in under a week. It plugged directly into the platform’s existing data models, tracking structured changes across their whole platform, including graphical design data structure, inputs and parameters. The platform now has a full timeline of design activity, with review and comments built in.

Looking ahead, the platform plans to use the history to train AI models that learn from real engineering workflows, helping the product team understand how engineers actually build and iterate using their software.

For users, the result feels like a true collaborative studio. They can experiment, review, and refine designs together, confident that every idea is captured and reversible.

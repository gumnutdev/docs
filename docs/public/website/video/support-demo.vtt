00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.879
 We made this for an insurance company where they wanted to use Gumnut to improve their support

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:13.279
 processes to support customers filling in a long complicated form. So this is a long health

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:25.160
 insurance form and like everything in Gumnut it's multi-user so if I open another tab and see the same fields you'll see the other users connected to this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 form and this form has conditionals across the tabs so you'll see that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.460
 different sub options are rendered across multiple tabs depending on which

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.000
 user fills them in and of course all the other fields could be filled in on any

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 on any page but the thing that we added for them

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.659
 is there's some support features.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.979
 And so on their admin page,

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.659
 these are the same fields, but in a different UI.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.780
 And so what they've got on the right-hand side

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.000
 is the support page, on the left hand side is the field.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 So when the support user opens the tab, you'll see them join.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 But we added some features to them, which was sometimes these fields are long and complicated,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 and finding a user inside their system is actually quite not necessarily easy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 So we added a jump to user button so they can jump to the user or even follow the user around.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.299
 So as they navigate the field, they can fill in all of the questions

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.200
 over the phone with the customer and make sure they get all of the information that's correct.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.900
 Either of them can type it in so they can type in the correct numbers

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.219
 and that the support staff can type it in so they can type in the correct numbers and that the support staff can type it in for them

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.680
 And they can collaborate to ensure the customer has a great experience using their product

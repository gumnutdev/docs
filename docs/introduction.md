# Introduction to Gumnut

Gumnut is a lightweight, real-time framework that adds collaboration to existing applications, and is primarily designed for your HTML forms.

It provides out of the box support for simultaneous editing, change attribution, version history and audit logging across any document.

::: tip
A [document](/guides/documents) is any set of values which belong together: A form, an entire page of forms, or just a single field.
It'll often reflect a database row.

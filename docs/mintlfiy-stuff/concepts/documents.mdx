Documents are the fundamental unit of organisation for Gumnut. Logically speaking, an individual document is a object which represents an instance of some identified set of user-facing data in your product. Some examples of Documents might be:
- Account-level, user-accessible configuration data 
- Individual blog pages
- The data entered into an instance of a form or wizard

Documents are comprised of Nodes; named items of data within each document, the values of which are tracked by Gumnut. For example, a document that represents a blog post might have nodes for:
- The title
- The body text
- The publication status

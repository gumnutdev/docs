# Gumnut Components

Gumnut provides a set of ready-to-use web components that make it easy to integrate collaborative editing into your applications. These components are built on top of the Gumnut API and handle all the complexities of real-time synchronization for you.
If you'd like to use React, check out [its API docs](/components/react).

## Available Components

Gumnut includes the following web components:

### Text Editing Components

- [**GumnutTextElement**](/components/gumnut-text): A multi-line text editing component for collaborative document editing
- [**GumnutInputElement**](/components/gumnut-input): A single-line text input for collaborative editing of titles, labels, or short text

### Data Components

- [**GumnutDataElement**](/components/gumnut-data): A component for synchronizing form controls like checkboxes and range inputs

### Utility Components

- [**GumnutStatusElement**](/components/gumnut-status): A component for monitoring and displaying connection status
- [**GumnutFocusElement**](/components/gumnut-focus): A component for monitoring and displaying connection status

## Importing Components

To use Gumnut components, import them in your JavaScript:

```javascript
// Import all Gumnut DOM components
import '@gumnutdev/api/dom';
```

After importing, you can use the components in your HTML:

```html
<gumnut-text id="editor"></gumnut-text>
<gumnut-input id="title"></gumnut-input>
```

## Common Usage Pattern

Gumnut components typically follow a similar pattern for use:

1. Create the component in your HTML
2. Get a node from a Gumnut document
3. Assign the node to the component's `node` property

```javascript
// Get a node from a document
const api = connectToGumnutDoc({ docId: 'your-doc', getToken: ... });

// Assign the node to a component
document.getElementById('editor').node = api.doc.useNode('text-content');
```

## Component Features

All Gumnut components automatically provide:

- Real-time synchronization of content
- User presence indicators (cursors and selections)
- Conflict resolution through operational transformation
- Appropriate styling and user feedback

## Styling Components

Gumnut components use Shadow DOM to render their contents, but can be styled using regular CSS: they start unstyled.
Common styling properties include:

```css
gumnut-text, gumnut-input {
  /* Dimensions */
  width: 100%;
  height: 300px;

/* Border and padding */
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 10px;

/* Typography */
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

For more detailed styling information, see each component's documentation.

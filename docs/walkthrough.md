# Getting Started with Gumnut

This guide will walk you through the process of enhancing an existing project with Gumnut, a collaborative editor that drops in anywhere, makes your products stickier, easier-to-use, plus providing full character-level attribution and history over time through its powerful database layer.

## Prerequisites

- A Node.JS dev environment
- npm (or your package manager of choice)
- A basic understanding of JavaScript and web components

You'll also need to sign up for a free account; head to the [Gumnut Dashboard](https://dashboard.dev.gumnut.dev/) to make one.

## The Example Site

We're going to add Gumnut's editing features to "Good Dogs with Gumnut", a one page VanillaJS app which you can clone from Gtihub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gumnutdev/good-dogs-demo.git && cd good-dogs-demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

::: tip
If you want to skip this guide and see a working version, checkout the `walkthrough-complete` branch
:::

Great, now our app is running at `localhost:5173`, and it'll live-reload when we save changes (thanks, [Vite](https://vite.dev)!)

The app consists of a pretty standard `index.html` page, some CSS, and an empty file called `script.js`, all served from the `/src/` directory. Those are all we need to change; Gumnut is framework agnostic and requires almost no changes to your backend.

We're going to add Gumnut's editing features to all four sets of input:

- The `dogName` text field
- The `description` text area
- Each of the checkboxes under _Winning Features_ (`floppyEars`, `boopableSnoot` and `toeBeans`)
- The `goodDogRange` slider

- Add [`gumnut-focus`](/components/gumnut-focus) to each element so we can see other users in the form
- [`gumnut-status`](/components/gumnut-status) to see the connnection status of the page

## Projects in Gumnut

Everything in Gumnut connects to a `Project` - which can contain a collection of Documents. First we need an account and create a new project.

![Creating a new project](/images/create-project.png)

## API Keys and Tokens

In order to edit a document, you need two kinds of access credentials:

- Firstly, an API key to connect to the Gumnut API
- Secondly, a token for each user which edits

Let's generate the first one now by logging in to the Gumnut dashboard and clicking on "API Keys", then "(local) dev key âœ…".

![Generating a new dev key](/images/getting-started/step-1-dashboard.png)

Click "Generate API Key" and copy the value from the "Local Dev Key" field; we'll need it in Step 1, below.

## Installation

Install the Gumnut package using npm (or your package manager of choice):

```bash
npm install @gumnutdev/api
```

::: tip
Gumnut follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and is under rapid development; You might want to pin a specific version during the beta.

## Adding basic Gumnut features

### 1. Configure Gumnut

The first think we need to do is `configureGumnut`, we need: host server, the projectId, and the apiKey. We can add all our necessary imports and configure Gumnut at the top of `client.js`.

We also need to import the Gumnut DOM elements.

```javascript
import {
  configureGumnut,
  connectToGumnutDoc,
  buildTestToken,
} from "@gumnutdev/api";

// import the DOM elements so <gumnut-text> etc. work in the HTML
import "@gumnutdev/api/dom";

configureGumnut({
  remoteHost: "v0-collab.dev.gumnut.dev",
  projectId: "your-project-id", // Demo uses 'good-dogs'
  localDevKey: "your-api-key", // Paste your Local Dev Key here
});
```

This should connect to your Gumnut project.

::: tip
This function can be skipped if you include these values as environment variables.
:::

### 2. Authenticate and Connect

Next we `connectToGumnutDoc` to tell Gumnut we want to start tracking this document. This methods takes two parameters:

- `docId`: A document ID which Gumnut will join (or create if it doesn't exist)
- `getToken`: A function which generates an authentication token

```javascript
const gumnutDoc = connectToGumnutDoc({
  docId: "good-dogs",
  getToken: () =>
    // undefined here means create a unique user id for each connection
    // (so the same person appears as a different color)
    buildTestToken(undefined, {
      name: "Bandit Heeler",
      email: "bandit.h@gumnut.dev",
      // picture: base64 image will include a picture of the user
    }),
}).doc; // the doc here is important!

await gumnutDoc.ready;
```

Now, about that `getToken` property. Gumnut is designed to be totally transparent to users; there's nothing to install, no permissions to grant and no login required. Instead, Gumnut calls the function passed as `getToken` to retrieve unique user tokens.

In Production, these take the form of a JWT generated via your backend with a call to Gumnut's API. For development (and demo) purposes, we're using the completely insecure `buildTestToken` method instead. For more on how Authentication in Gumnut works, see the [Authentication Guide](/guides/authentication).

::: warning
It's worth repeating: don't use `buildTestToken` in Production. Your security team will be sad and we'll have to charge you a lot of money if jerks on the Internet use it to cram your documents with nonsense.
:::

Gumnut uses the parameters passed to `buildTestToken` to attribute (eg associated) changes to a specific user. The first parameter is the user's unique ID; the second parameter is an object containing the users details, which will be displayed to other users.

### 3. Working with Text Inputs using `<gumnut-text>`

For each input we want to collaborate on, we need a Node. Nodes are named properties that store a value your users can edit; Documents are made up of collections of Nodes. Each independent value needs its own Node, which Gumnut creates the first time it's used.

Let's start with the `dogName` field. We'll replace the existing element with the built-in `<gumnut-text>` web component; this will let us keep track of changes and also add a cursor showing where each connected user is editing.

```html
<!-- Replace this -->
<input
  type="text"
  class="input"
  placeholder="Rover"
  id="dogName"
  name="dogName"
/>

<!-- With this -->
<gumnut-text class="input" placeholder="Rover" id="dogName" name="dogName" />
```

Next, create/retrieve a node from the Document, and associate it with the input field.

```javascript
document.getElementById("dogName").node = gumnutDoc.useNode("dogName");
```

That should be all you need to see it works! Let's check by opening a new tab and typing stuff.

![Test it out!](/images/getting-started/typing-gumnut.gif)

Woohoo! ðŸ¥³

Next, let's do the same for the `description` textarea. The process is the same, except we need to add the `multiline` attribute to `<gumnut-text>`:

```html
<!-- Replace this -->
<textarea
  name="description"
  placeholder="Dog-shaped with a dog aroma and a dog personality. Very good dog."
  ...
></textarea>

<!-- With this -->
<gumnut-text
  multiline
  name="description"
  placeholder="Dog-shaped with a dog aroma and a dog personality. Very good dog."
  ...
></gumnut-text>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById("description").node = gumnutDoc.useNode("description");
```

And you're done. That's all it takes to start editing a field with Gumnut. Open the page in two browser windows and you should see changes in one window seamlessly replicate in the other.

### 4. Working with Other Inputs using `<gumnut-data>`

When a text value changes, we need to know what part of the value (eg, which characters) changed and indicate those changes with a cursor; this is what the `<gumnut-text>` element does for us. For other inputs, we only need to track changes to the value as a whole. That's where the `<gumnut-data>` element comes in. It wraps around `input` or `select` element with atomic values (eg, those which change from one value to another "all at once").

Let's use `<gumnut-data>` elements to track changes to the Winning Features checkboxes and the Good Dog range slider:

```html
<gumnut-data id="floppyEars">
  <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" name="floppyEars" checked />
</gumnut-data>

<gumnut-data id="boopableSnoot">
  <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" name="Boopable Snoot" />
</gumnut-data>

<gumnut-data id="toeBeans">
  <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" name="ToeBeans" />
</gumnut-data>

<gumnut-data id="goodDog">
  <input
    type="range"
    id="goodDog"
    name="goodDog"
    min="0"
    max="100"
    value="50"
  />
</gumnut-data>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById("floppyEars").node = gumnutDoc.useNode("floppyEars");
document.getElementById("boopableSnoot").node =
  gumnutDoc.useNode("boopableSnoot");
document.getElementById("toeBeans").node = gumnutDoc.useNode("toeBeans");
document.getElementById("goodDogRange").node =
  gumnutDoc.useNode("goodDogRange");
```

### 5. Commiting Changes.

Great! Now all of our inputs are syncing across browsers. Not only that; all of your changes are captured by Gumnut. If you open the [Data Index panel](https://dashboard.dev.gumnut.dev/), navigate to your projects, and click the Data tab, and open it side-by-side with your app, you'll see all the changes users are making while they're being made.

![Changes are reflected in the dashboard as users type](/images/getting-started/step-5-dashboard-pending.gif)

Gumnut tracks changes to your Document over time as a series of revisions. The `pending` revision shows all changes made to a document since the last time changes were comitted. You can ask Gumnut to create a Snapshot revision with a timestamp and the contents of the document at that point by calling `doc.actions.commit`.

This function takes a callback which you can use to submit data to your application. The `commit` function passes the callback an object whose properties are the changed nodes. If the callback succeeds, Gumnut captures a Snapshot; if it fails, it doesn't.

```javascript
document.getElementById("save").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  try {
    await gumnutDoc.actions.commit(async (changes) => {
      console.log("Beep Boop, Saving to Your Database:", changes);
    });

    console.log("Document snapshot created");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error saving document", error);
  }
});
```

Now, each revision shows up in our dashboard as a Snapshot. Neat!

![Snapshots capture your form over time](/images/getting-started/step-5-dashboard-snapshots.gif)

### 6. Focus & Status.

Gumnut also provides two elements which surface information about the current document: `<gumnut-focus>` and `<gumnut-status>`.

When a `<gumnut-focus>` element is assigned to a node, it shows an icon for each user currently editing that node. You can place a `<gumnut-focus>` element anywhere on the page, but it typically makes the most sense to place them next to the input bound to the same node.

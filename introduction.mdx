# Introduction to Gumnut

Gumnut is a lightweight, real-time framework that adds collaboration to existing applications, and is primarily designed for your HTML forms.

It provides out of the box support for simultaneous editing, change attribution, version history and audit logging across any document.

<Tip>A [document](/guides/documents) is any set of values which belong together: A form, an entire page of forms, or just a single field.
It'll often reflect a database row.</Tip>

{/* Implement collaborative features using Gumnut's pre-built web components and plugins, or enhance any existing app with using the flexible API. Gumnut makes it easy for teams of any size to implement collaborative features in your applications, with end-to-end encryption and no database access required. */}

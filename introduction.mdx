# Introduction to Gumnut

Gumnut is a lightweight, real-time collaborative editing framework that enables multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document. A document, right now, is a whole HTML form, including all data inputs like text fields, sliders, check boxes, etc.

It provides both an API and web components for easily implementing collaborative features in your applications.

Out of the tin you get real-time collaboration, character-level attribution (who wrote what), and complete version history.

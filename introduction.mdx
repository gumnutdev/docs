# Introduction to Gumnut

Gumnut is a lightweight, real-time collaborative editing framework that enables multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document. It provides both a JavaScript API and web components for easily implementing collaborative features in your applications.

## Key Features

- **Real-time collaboration** - Multiple users can edit documents simultaneously with changes synced in real-time
- **Operational transformation** - Advanced conflict resolution ensures reliable synchronization between users
- **Custom web components** - Ready-to-use UI components like `<gumnut-input>` and `<gumnut-textarea>` for immediate integration 
- **Cursor presence** - See other users' cursors and selections with automatic visual indicators
- **Flexible architecture** - Support for custom document structures and multi-user editing
- **Authentication support** - Built-in token-based authentication system

## How It Works

Gumnut works by maintaining a synchronized state between all connected clients through a central server. When a user makes changes to a document, those changes are:

1. Captured locally as operations
2. Transmitted to the Gumnut server
3. Transformed against other concurrent operations if necessary
4. Applied to all connected clients
5. Visually represented in the UI with custom elements that show user presence

This all happens with minimal latency, creating a seamless collaborative experience.

## When to Use Gumnut

Gumnut is ideal for applications that require:

- Document editing with multiple simultaneous users
- Live collaboration features
- Real-time data synchronization
- User presence indicators
- Structured document collaboration

## Installation

```bash
npm install gumnut-v0-api
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
import { connectToGumnut, buildTestToken } from 'gumnut-v0-api';
import 'gumnut-v0-api/dom';

// Create an AbortController to manage the connection lifecycle
const controller = new AbortController();

// Connect to Gumnut
const gumnut = connectToGumnut(controller.signal, {
  projectId: 'your-project-id'
});

// Provide authentication token
const token = buildTestToken('user-123', { name: 'User Name', email: 'user@example.com' });
gumnut.provideToken(token);

// Join a document
const doc = gumnut.join(controller.signal, 'doc-123');

// Use the document with a Gumnut component
document.querySelector('gumnut-textarea').document = doc.forNode('text-content');
```

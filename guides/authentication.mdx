# Authentication in Gumnut

Gumnut uses token-based authentication to identify users and manage access to collaborative documents.

## Authentication Flow

When connecting to Gumnut, you need to provide the `getToken` property with a method to call to obtain secure tokens: 

```javascript
const doc = connectToGumnutDoc({
    docId: "good-dogs",
    getToken: () => someTokenMethod
    )
}).doc
```

Gumnut will call this method whenever it needs a new token (on startup, or if an existing token expires):

2. Gumnut calls the method
3. Your backend generates and returns a token
5. Gumnut validates the token and associates the user with their edits
6. Other users can see who made which changes

### Development Tokens

For development and testing, Gumnut provides a helper function to create test tokens:

```javascript
import { buildTestToken } from 'gumnut-v0-api';

const doc = connectToGumnutDoc({
    docId: "good-dogs",
    getToken: () => buildTestToken('bandit-h', {
        name: 'Bandit',
        email: 'bandit.h@gumnut.dev'
    })
}).doc
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Test tokens should only be used during development. They are not secure for production use.

### Production Tokens

In production, you should generate proper JWT tokens on your server:

1. Your server authenticates users through your normal auth flow
2. Your server generates a JWT token with the user's ID and info
3. Your client receives this token and provides it to Gumnut


## User Identity

When a token is provided, Gumnut extracts the user identity from it:

- The `sub` claim becomes the user's unique ID
- The `name` claim (if present) is used to show the user's name in the UI
- The `email` claim (if present) can be shown in user presence indicators

## Multiple Users and Presence

Gumnut uses the provided tokens to identify who is making each edit. This enables:

- Displaying the name or email of users currently editing
- Showing colored cursors and selections for each user
- Attributing text to the users who wrote it

## Security Considerations

When implementing authentication for Gumnut, keep these security best practices in mind:

1. **Token Generation**: Generate tokens on your server, not in the browser
2. **Token Expiration**: Set appropriate expiration times for tokens
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to protect tokens in transit
4. **Scoped Access**: Consider generating tokens that are scoped to specific documents
5. **Token Storage**: Store tokens securely; don't store in localStorage for sensitive applications

## Server-side JWT Generation

Here's an example of how you might generate a JWT on your server (Node.js example):

```javascript
// Server-side code
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function generateGumnutToken(user) {
  // Create the payload
  const payload = {
    sub: user.id,
    name: user.displayName,
    email: user.email
  };
  
  // Sign the token with your secret key
  const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.GUMNUT_JWT_SECRET, {
    expiresIn: '24h'
  });
  
  return token;
}

// In your API route handler
app.get('/api/auth/gumnut-token', authenticate, (req, res) => {
  const token = generateGumnutToken(req.user);
  res.json({ token });
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **Invalid Token**: Check that your token is properly formatted and signed
2. **Expired Token**: Verify that the token hasn't expired
3. **User ID Mismatch**: Ensure you're not trying to change user IDs during a session

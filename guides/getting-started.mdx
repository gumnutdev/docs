# Getting Started with Gumnut

This guide will walk you through the process of enhancing an existing project with Gumnut, a collaborative editor that drops in anywhere, makes your products stickier, easier-to-use, plus providing full character-level attribution and history over time through its powerful database layer.

## Prerequisites

- A Node.JS dev environment
- npm or yarn
- A basic understanding of JavaScript and web components

You'll also need to sign up for a free account; Head to https://gumnut.dev/ to join the waitlist.

## The Example Site

We're going to add Gumnut's editing features to "Good Dogs with Gumnut", a one page VanillaJS app which you can clone from Gtihub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gumnutdev/good-dogs-demo.git good-dogs
cd good-dogs
npm install
```

If you look in the `/src/client` directory, you'll see the app consists of a pretty standard `index.html` page, some CSS, and an empty file called `client.js`. Those are all we need to change; Gumnut is entirely framework agnostic.

For now, start the app and check it out in your browser at http://localhost:3000

`npm run dev`

It would be great if multiple users could describe doggos at once, so we're going to add Gumnut's collaborative editing capabilities to all four sets of input:

- The `dogName` text field
- The `description` text area
- Each of the checkboxes under *Winning Features* (`floppyEars`, `boopableSnoot` and `toeBeans`)
- The `goodDogRange` slider

## API Keys and Tokens

In order to edit a document, you need two kinds of access credentials:

- Firstly, an API key to connect to the Gumnut API
- Secondly, a token for each user which edits 

Let's generate the first one now by logging in to the Gumnut dashboard and clicking on "API Keys", then "(local) dev key âœ…".

<Frame caption="Generating a new dev key">
  ![Generating a new dev key](/images/getting-started/step-1-dashboard.png)
</Frame>

Click "Generate API Key" and copy the value from the "Local Dev Key" field; we'll need it in Step 2, below.


//TODO This is where we describe setting up the project in the Dashboard, generating keys. Screenshots probably go here.

## Installation

Install the Gumnut package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install gumnut-v0-api
# or
yarn add gumnut-v0-api
```

<Tip>Gumnut follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and is under rapid development; You might want to pin a specific version during the beta.</Tip>

## Adding basic Gumnut features

### 1. Establish a connection to Gumnut

After importing Gumnut at the top of `client.js`, then use Gumnut's `AbortController` (which controls Gumnut's lifecycle) to establish a connection using the local dev key you created earlier.

```javascript client.js: Establishing a connection to Gumnut
import { connectToGumnut, buildTestToken } from 'gumnut-v0-api';
import 'gumnut-v0-api/dom';

const controller = new AbortController();

const gumnut = connectToGumnut(controller.signal, {
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  localDevKey: 'your-dev-key',
  host: "v0-collab.dev.gumnut.dev",
});

```

### 2. Authenticate the user

Gumnut is designed to be totally transparent to users; there's nothing for them to install, no permissions to grant and no 3rd party login required. Instead unique user tokens are used to join a Document for editing.

In Production, this token takes the form of a JWT generated server-side with a call to Gumnut's API. For development (and demo) purposes, we'll use the completely insecure `buildTestToken` method instead.

<Note>It's worth repeating: don't use `buildTestToken`in Production. Your security team will be sad and we'll have to charge you a lot of money if jerks on the Internet use it to cram your documents with nonsense.</Note>

Gumnut uses the parameters passed to `buildTestToken` to attribute (eg associated) changes to a specific user. The first parameter is the user's unique ID; the second parameter is an object containing name and email, which will be displayed to other users.

Once the token is provided, calling `gumnut.join` with the AbortController and a document ID will join that Document (or create it if it doesn't exist! Handy). 

```javascript client.js Generating a user token (insecurely)
const token = buildTestToken('bandit-h', { 
  name: 'Bandit Heeler', 
  email: 'Bandit.h@gumnut.dev' 
});

gumnut.provideToken(token);

const doc = gumnut.join(controller.signal, 'my-first-document');
await doc.ready;
```


### 3. Working with Text Inputs using `<gumnut-text>`

For each input we want to collaborate on, we need a Node. Nodes are named properties that store a value your users can edit; Documents are made up of collections of Nodes. Each independent value needs its own Node, which Gumnut creates the first time it's used.

Let's start with the `dogName` field. We'll replace the existing element with the built-in web component `<gumnut-text>` element; this will let us keep track of changes and also add a cursor showing where each connected user is editing.

```html index.html replacing the dogName field
// Replace this
<input type="text" class="p-3 input border-[1px] border-surface-300-700" placeholder="Rover" id="dogName" name="dogName"></input>

// With this
<gumnut-text type="text" class="p-3 input border-[1px] border-surface-300-700" placeholder="Rover" id="dogName" name="dogName"></gumnut-text>
```

Next, create/retrieve a node from the Document, and associate it with the input field.

```javascript client.js creating and associating a node
document.getElementById('dogName').node = doc.forNode('dogName');
```

Next, let's do the same for the `description` textarea. The process is the same, except we need to add the `multiline` attribute to `<gumnut-text>`:

<CodeGroup>
```html index.html
// Replace this
 <textarea name="description" placeholder="Dog-shaped with a dog aroma and a dog personality. Very good dog." ...></textarea>

// With this
 <gumnut-text multiline="true" name="description" placeholder="Dog-shaped with a dog aroma and a dog personality. Very good dog." ... ></gumnut-text>
```

```javascript client.js
document.getElementById('description').node = doc.forNode('description');
```
</CodeGroup>

And you're done. That's all it takes to start editing a field with Gumnut. Open the page in two browser windows and you should see changes in one window seamlessly replicate in the other.

### 4. Working with Other Inputs using `<gumnut-data>`

Because our remaining elements aren't text (and thus don't need a cursor have individual characters), we'll instead use `<gumnut-data>` elements to manage them.




## Using Gumnut with HTML

The simplest way to integrate Gumnut is to use the built-in web components:

```html
<gumnut-textarea id="editor"></gumnut-textarea>
```

Then, link it to your Gumnut node:

```javascript
// Assign the node to the textarea component
document.getElementById('editor').node = textNode;
```

## Complete Example

Here's a full example that sets up a collaborative text editor:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Gumnut Collaborative Editor</title>
  <style>
    gumnut-textarea {
      width: 100%;
      height: 300px;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
      padding: 10px;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Collaborative Editor</h1>
  <gumnut-textarea id="editor"></gumnut-textarea>
  <gumnut-status id="status"></gumnut-status>

  <script type="module">
    import { connectToGumnut, buildTestToken } from 'gumnut-v0-api';
    import 'gumnut-v0-api/dom';

    // Setup the connection
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const gumnut = connectToGumnut(controller.signal, {
      projectId: 'your-project-id'
    });

    // Authenticate
    const userId = `user-${Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)}`;
    const token = buildTestToken(userId, { 
      name: `User ${userId}`, 
      email: `${userId}@example.com` 
    });
    gumnut.provideToken(token);

    // Show connection status
    document.getElementById('status').gumnutApi = gumnut;

    // Join a document
    const doc = gumnut.join(controller.signal, 'shared-document');
    
    // Connect the textarea to a node in the document
    document.getElementById('editor').node = doc.forNode('text-content');

    // Optional: Create a snapshot when the page unloads
    window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
      doc.snapshot();
      controller.abort();
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

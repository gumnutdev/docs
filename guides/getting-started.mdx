# Getting Started with Gumnut

This guide will walk you through the process of enhancing an existing project with Gumnut, a collaborative editor that drops in anywhere, makes your products stickier, easier-to-use, plus providing full character-level attribution and history over time through its powerful database layer.

## Prerequisites

- A Node.JS dev environment
- npm or yarn
- A basic understanding of JavaScript and web components

You'll also need to sign up for a free account; Head to https://gumnut.dev/ to join the waitlist.

## The Example Site

We're going to add Gumnut's editing features to "Good Dogs with Gumnut", a one page VanillaJS app which you can clone from Gtihub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gumnutdev/good-dogs-demo.git good-dogs
cd good-dogs
npm install
npm run dev
```

Great, now our app is running at http://localhost:3000, and it'll live-reload when we save changes (thanks, [Vite](https://vite.dev)!)

The app consists of a pretty standard `index.html` page, some CSS, and an empty file called `client.js`, all served from the `/src/client` directory. Those are all we need to change; Gumnut is framework agnostic and requires almost no changes to your backend.

We're going to add Gumnut's editing features to all four sets of input:

- The `dogName` text field
- The `description` text area
- Each of the checkboxes under *Winning Features* (`floppyEars`, `boopableSnoot` and `toeBeans`)
- The `goodDogRange` slider

## API Keys and Tokens

In order to edit a document, you need two kinds of access credentials:

- Firstly, an API key to connect to the Gumnut API
- Secondly, a token for each user which edits 

Let's generate the first one now by logging in to the Gumnut dashboard and clicking on "API Keys", then "(local) dev key âœ…".

<Frame caption="Generating a new dev key">
  ![Generating a new dev key](/images/getting-started/step-1-dashboard.png)
</Frame>

Click "Generate API Key" and copy the value from the "Local Dev Key" field; we'll need it in Step 2, below.


//TODO This is where we describe setting up the project in the Dashboard, generating keys. Screenshots probably go here.

## Installation

Install the Gumnut package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install gumnut-v0-api
# or
yarn add gumnut-v0-api
```

<Tip>Gumnut follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and is under rapid development; You might want to pin a specific version during the beta.</Tip>

## Adding basic Gumnut features

### 1. Establish a connection to Gumnut

After importing Gumnut at the top of `client.js`, then use Gumnut's `AbortController` (which controls Gumnut's lifecycle) to establish a connection using the local dev key you created earlier.

```javascript client.js: Establishing a connection to Gumnut
import { connectToGumnut, buildTestToken } from 'gumnut-v0-api';
import 'gumnut-v0-api/dom';

const controller = new AbortController();

const gumnut = connectToGumnut(controller.signal, {
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  localDevKey: 'your-dev-key',
  host: "v0-collab.dev.gumnut.dev",
});

```

### 2. Authenticate the user

Gumnut is designed to be totally transparent to users; there's nothing for them to install, no permissions to grant and no 3rd party login required. Instead unique user tokens are used to join a Document for editing.

In Production, this token takes the form of a JWT generated server-side with a call to Gumnut's API. For development (and demo) purposes, we'll use the completely insecure `buildTestToken` method instead.

<Note>It's worth repeating: don't use `buildTestToken`in Production. Your security team will be sad and we'll have to charge you a lot of money if jerks on the Internet use it to cram your documents with nonsense.</Note>

Gumnut uses the parameters passed to `buildTestToken` to attribute (eg associated) changes to a specific user. The first parameter is the user's unique ID; the second parameter is an object containing name and email, which will be displayed to other users.

Once the token is provided, calling `gumnut.join` with the AbortController and a document ID will join that Document (or create it if it doesn't exist! Handy). 

```javascript client.js: Generating a user token (insecurely)
const token = buildTestToken('bandit-h', { 
  name: 'Bandit Heeler', 
  email: 'Bandit.h@gumnut.dev' 
});

gumnut.provideToken(token);

const doc = gumnut.join(controller.signal, 'good-dogs');
await doc.ready;
```


### 3. Working with Text Inputs using `<gumnut-text>`

For each input we want to collaborate on, we need a Node. Nodes are named properties that store a value your users can edit; Documents are made up of collections of Nodes. Each independent value needs its own Node, which Gumnut creates the first time it's used.

Let's start with the `dogName` field. We'll replace the existing element with the built-in  `<gumnut-text>`  web component; this will let us keep track of changes and also add a cursor showing where each connected user is editing.

```html index.html: replacing the dogName field
// Replace this
<input type="text" class="p-3 input border-[1px] border-surface-300-700" placeholder="Rover" id="dogName" name="dogName"></input>

// With this
<gumnut-text type="text" class="p-3 input border-[1px] border-surface-300-700" placeholder="Rover" id="dogName" name="dogName"></gumnut-text>
```

Next, create/retrieve a node from the Document, and associate it with the input field.

```javascript client.js: creating and associating a node
document.getElementById('dogName').node = doc.forNode('dogName');
```

Next, let's do the same for the `description` textarea. The process is the same, except we need to add the `multiline` attribute to `<gumnut-text>`:

<CodeGroup>
```html index.html
// Replace this
 <textarea name="description" placeholder="Dog-shaped with a dog aroma and a dog personality. Very good dog." ...></textarea>

// With this
 <gumnut-text multiline="true" name="description" placeholder="Dog-shaped with a dog aroma and a dog personality. Very good dog." ... ></gumnut-text>
```

```javascript client.js
document.getElementById('description').node = doc.forNode('description');
```
</CodeGroup>

And you're done. That's all it takes to start editing a field with Gumnut. Open the page in two browser windows and you should see changes in one window seamlessly replicate in the other.

### 4. Working with Other Inputs using `<gumnut-data>`

When a text value changes, we need to know what part of the value (eg, which characters) changed and indicate those changes with a cursor; this is what the `<gumnut-text>` element does for us. For other inputs, we only need to track changes to the value as a whole. That's where the `<gumnut-data>` element comes in. It wraps around `input` or `select` element with atomic values (eg, those which change from one value to another "all at once").

Let's use `<gumnut-data>` elements to track changes to the Winning Features checkboxes and the Good Dog range slider.

<CodeGroup>
```html index.html: Wrap elements with gumnut-data
<gumnut-data id="floppyEars">  
    <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" name="floppyEars" checked />
    <p class="text-sm">Floppy Ears</p>
</gumnut-data>

<gumnut-data id="boopableSnoot">
    <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" name="boopableSnoot" />
    <p class="text-sm">Boopable Snoot</p>
</gumnut-data>

<gumnut-data id="toeBeans">
    <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" name="toeBeans" />
    <p class="text-sm">Toe Beans</p>
</gumnut-data>

<other-markup-omitted />

<gumnut-data id="goodDogRange" class="grow">
    <input class="input" type="range" id="goodDog" name="goodDog" value="150" min="100" max="200">
</gumnut-data>
```

```javascript client.js: Attach nodes
const floppyEarsNode = doc.forNode('floppyEars')
document.getElementById('floppyEars').node = floppyEarsNode;

const boopableSnootNode = doc.forNode('boopableSnoot')
document.getElementById('boopableSnoot').node = boopableSnootNode;

const toeBeansNode = doc.forNode('toeBeans')
document.getElementById('toeBeans').node = toeBeansNode;

const goodDogRangeNode = doc.forNode('goodDogRange')
document.getElementById('goodDogRange').node = goodDogRangeNode;
```
</CodeGroup>

### 5. Commiting Changes.

Great! Now all of our inputs are syncing across browsers. Not only that; all of your changes are captured by Gumnut. If you open the [Data Index panel](https://dashboard.dev.gumnut.dev/project/good-dogs/data) of the dashboard side-by-side with your app, you'll see all the changes users are making while they're being made.

<Frame caption="Changes are reflected in the dashboard as users type">
  ![Generating a new dev key](/images/getting-started/step-5-dashboard-pending.gif)
</Frame>

Gumnut tracks changes to your Document over time as a series of revisions.  The `pending` revision shows all changes made to a document since the last time changes were comitted. You can ask Gumnut to create a Snapshot revision with a timestamp and the contents of the document at that point by calling `doc.actions.commit`.

This function takes a callback which you can use to submit data to your application. The `commit` function passes the callback an object whose properties are the changed nodes. If the callback succeeds, Gumnut captures a Snapshot; if it fails, it doesn't.

```javascript client.js: saving snapshots
document.getElementById('save').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        await doc.actions.commit(async (changes) => {
            console.log('Beep Boop, Saving to Your Database:', changes);
        });

        console.log('Document snapshot created'); 
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error saving document", error);
    }
});
```

Now, each revision shows up in our dashboard as a Snapshot. Neat!

</Frame>

### 6. Focus & Status.

Gumnut also provides two elements which surface information about the current document: `<gumnut-focus>` and `<gumnut-status>`.

When a `<gumnut-focus>` element is assigned to a node, it shows an icon for each user currently editing that node. You can place a `<gumnut-focus>` element anywhere on the page, but it typically makes the most sense to place them next to the input bound to the same node. 

<CodeGroup>
``html index.html: add gumnut-focus elements for dogName and description
<gumnut-text type="text" id="dogName" name="dogName"></gumnut-text>
<gumnut-focus id="dogNameFocus"></gumnut-focus>

<gumnut-text multiline="true" resize="auto" id="description" name="description" rows="4"></gumnut-text>
<gumnut-focus id="descriptionFocus"></gumnut-focus>
``

```javascript client.js: setting nodes for dogNameFocus and description
const dogNameNode = doc.forNode('dogName')
document.getElementById('dogName').node = dogNameNode;
document.getElementById('dogNameFocus').node = dogNameNode;

const descriptionNode = doc.forNode('description')
document.getElementById('description').node = descriptionNode;
document.getElementById('descriptionFocus').node = descriptionNode;
```
</CodeGroup>
